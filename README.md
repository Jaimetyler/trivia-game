trivia game

This is an Atlanta Braves Trivia game. I attempted a couple of versions of this game, the first attempt being the harder version and when I was running out of time, I tried to just complete the easier to see if i could get a complete game going. 

//hardAttempt.js 
The game is supposed to start on a click of a button and bring in a question with a set of answers. The user then selects a choice given for the answers and a screen appears with the correct answer with an image and a message about being right or wrong. then using setTimeout(), a new question should appear. I could not get the new question to appear, but rather the answers would just loops through after the user chose something for the first answer. I think i could complete this if i had a little more time to just start over. I have to submit this now, but I will come back tomorrow night and hopefully be able to fix it before graded.
